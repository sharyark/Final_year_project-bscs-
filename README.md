# Face Recognition System

This repository contains the code for a Face Recognition System developed as part of a Final Year Project (FYP). The system is designed to automate user attendance and surveillance using facial recognition technology.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to express our gratitude to Allah Almighty and the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) for blessing us with their grace and guiding us to a successful culmination of this project. Special thanks to our esteemed guide, Mr. Nouman Al Hassan, for providing invaluable guidance and advice throughout the project. We also extend our thanks to all faculty members and our friends and family for their unwavering support and encouragement.

## Introduction

The Face Recognition System aims to streamline attendance management and surveillance processes in educational institutions and organizations. Traditional methods of attendance tracking are often time-consuming and prone to errors. This system leverages facial recognition technology to automatically identify individuals and mark their attendance, thus saving time and improving accuracy.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- Detect faces in real-time video streams.
- Extract facial features for identification.
- Compare extracted features with stored data for recognition.
- Automatically mark attendance based on matched faces.
- Provide efficient surveillance capabilities.
- Maintain accurate attendance records with images.

## Project Scope

The system can be implemented in various organizations, ranging from educational institutions to multinational companies. It offers a user-friendly admin portal for managing attendance records and surveillance footage. The system ensures security, access control, reliability, efficiency, and performance in attendance and surveillance management.

## Tools for Development

### Back-end Tools and Technologies:
- Python (Django)
- OpenCV
- MySQL

### Front-end Tools and Technologies:
- HTML/CSS (Bootstrap)
- JavaScript

## Hardware Requirement

- Computers with a minimum Core i3 processor or higher, 64GB of free hard drive space, 4GB of RAM or more, and a GPU.
- Cameras for capturing video streams.

## Deployment

- Web Browser (Preferred: Google Chrome)
- WSGI or ASGI Python Standard Web Server
- MySQL DBMS based on Linux OS

## Study of Existing System

Managing student attendance using manual methods is prone to errors and inefficiencies. The proposed system aims to overcome these challenges by automating attendance tracking through facial recognition technology.

## Proposed System

The automatic attendance system using facial recognition automates the process of marking attendance by extracting facial features from video streams and comparing them with stored data. This system offers benefits such as time savings, improved accuracy, and enhanced security.

## Requirement Analysis

The project follows the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and encompasses functional and non-functional requirements.

### Functional Requirements

- Admin functionalities include user account management and attendance tracking.
- User functionalities include viewing attendance data.

### Non-functional Requirements

- Security measures to protect against unauthorized access.
- Usability features for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- Performance requirements for fast and reliable operation.
- Reliability features for data backup and recovery.
- Access control measures to prevent unauthorized access to data.
